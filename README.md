# GainAdaptation
This repository contains experimetal data in the format of MATLAB files used in Ikegami et al.'s paper "Reach adaptation to a visuomotor gain with terminal error feedback involves reinforcement learning". MATLAB needed to be installed to open the data files.

EC.m, ET.m, and R.m include the data of reach distance and target direction in each trial throughout the experiment (training phase to transfer phase) for the EC, ET, and R groups, respectively.
